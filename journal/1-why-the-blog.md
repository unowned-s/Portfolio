My goal in coming up with this portfolio and blog was just to learn writing.

Technology and Theology are two topics that interest me much. It keeps me on the edge and keep discovering. Nobody is born a techie or a theologian or even a writer. Writing is an art that needs to be cultivated over time (at least for me). Writing makes me think how careful I need to be in choosing the words. It helps improve my vocabulary and makes difficult subjects/topics easy to understand.

Theology (study of God), in itself, is vast. Theologians take years to learn and teach others. I do pursue theology in my own space, it's pure joy. Every time I read, it's like I've barely scratched the surface.

But, to write? and on theology, it's so very risky waters. Since I have not been so fortunate enough to get a formal education on the subject, I like to take it as a challenge. There's nothing to lose and all to gain. Exploration of any kind is fun in itself. Please read the <a href="/disclaimer">disclaimer </a> here, before you come to any conclusion.

Last, I would also like to write on Technology. I'd like to give out some simple concepts and methodologies in programming which I feel would be beneficial to the new wanderers. Cheers ðŸŽ‰
