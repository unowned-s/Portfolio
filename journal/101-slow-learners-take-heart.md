In a world of quick learning, people are in a big rush to learn just about everything.
I'm a "software engineer" and I am kinda proud to say that, well… not really. Why coz I never wanted to become one, super honest here. In high school, I did Vocational Studies with a focus on Automobile Engineering, I never knew I wanted to do that. I cleared the exams with just enough grades and soon after, I started working as a sales representative on a door-to-door sales job and…. if you're guessing I didn't want to be that either.

I grew up partly never figuring out what am I going to do all my life, or do I even have to worry about it. I walked into every door not knowing anything.

## The career and the discipline!!

My career in software is simply a huge surprise to me. I might have done just a few weeks of web development courses and built a few websites for friends, none of which still live, or even pursued my graduation in computer application just for the sake.

It was 2014 when Apple introduced the new programming language called by the name "Swift", it kinda caught my attention. I said I am going to learn the language and become good at it and develop a few apps. Since I didn't have a Mac computer and only a windows system at home, I took a couple of 200 pages notebook and would write the swift language syntaxes every day. I did it for almost 2 years, the variables, constants, functions, conditional statements and classes, and protocols, generics, etc. It was almost like me learning A for apple, B=ball, C=cat. That's how it was for me.
I am a slow learner and children nowadays can tell you the names of fruits and vegetables very well, I didn't (and still don't) know. I can speak almost 6 languages and yet won't be able to tell you those names in any language.
Learning something completely foreign to my mind takes time.

## Putting the effort!!

Me pursuing to learn app development hasn't been easy. I just made one app and called myself a developer (initially), we all like that a little bit of praise isn't it?. But, mind you, I changed states to go and learn ios app development. To my surprise, no training institute was able to train me coz no qualified teacher which is another story. I realized it's me or no one. I was looking for just one chance, and I would grab it all.

## Patience has been the key!!

I joined a company where I work currently through a reference by a friend, where I almost got fired 3 times. Sticking through all that meant one thing - It's not the end of it. My learning hasn't stopped. My proud moments are not how many projects I can handle now or bugs I can fix without reopening. It's been simply me doing what I truly, deeply love as part of my vocation, it's what fuels me to keep going. If it meant I go hungry some days, no problem, if there were/are difficult days, it - doesn't - matter. I can still wear a smile and happily go to the office, and sit and just simply work (not a workaholic though). Salary has never been the motivation, though I still need it.

## What's the point in all this?.

Researches have shown that it takes years to develop expertise in any field/profession or sport.
You can do something because you get good money and end up making your life miserable by trying to become the jack of all trade and mastering none OR you can do something you love and enjoy the calmness and the subtle joy the life gives.

So if you're a slow learner, take heart!
