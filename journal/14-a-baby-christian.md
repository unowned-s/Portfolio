excerpt: Saul was required just plain, simple, obedience, no putting on a show. God is not impressed with the kind of stuff we do as much as He is with obedience.

_<small>Please read <a href="/my-great-exploits">first part</a> of this series to get a bit of context. This one is going to be a little hard to take in, so put on your seat-belts.</small>_

As I look back, I am the same guy who _talked some deep theological stuff once in a while,_ not realizing the chaos deep within. I have sat in the pew and sometimes stood at the pulpit, submitted to those who watch over my soul - for over a decade, not knowing what was happening.

I have experienced all the emotional highs that's how strong the environment was. The music goes from a couple of fast songs to a bit slower ones, add some colored lights, remove the chairs and do the dance. When the music is over, stand and speak what "god" spoke. I don't know about others, but I wasn't getting free.

By the time I have come down from the church, I'm feeling so good about what I spoke or what I prayed - _I'm on a complete high without any drug_.  My prayers were much like sitting in a car with a foot on the accelerator pedal and shifting gears from 1 to 6. You can call it innocence but that me speaking on "what god spoke" to "me" (I'm guessing) was just a cover-up for a much deeper turmoil within. I just fooled myself and maybe everyone else.

What I or anyone could speak was not aligned to the scriptures, maybe a little here and there but largely _it was just on the surface_.

I am accountable, I submit to those in authority, and they watch over me. But If I can easily manipulate people (which I usually don't know I'm doing), I have become vulnerable to all sorts of demonic activities in my life. These are spiritual matters which need discernment. Anyone encouraging me further by being nice or by saying "whoa what a word I shared", is not gonna help. _Compassion without truth isn’t love, it’s flattery._ After all what purpose does it serve anyway. God will never contradict His Word.

Our fickle emotions, and imaginations shooting all across with the closed eyes due to the music or sometimes we want to impress everyone around, or even speak things presumptuously. When we get caught up with things like these, the Gospel is completely sidelined. To hear _"God loves you"_ or any similar surface-level phrases, at that point was not helping me at all. Some more common ones, like _"The perfect love casts out all fear"_, _"We're not saved by our works"_, _"Bible is not about do and don't do's"_, etc.

> _For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation﻿ for all people, 12 instructing us to deny godlessness﻿ and worldly lusts﻿ and to live in a sensible, righteous, and godly﻿ way in the present age, 13 while we wait for the blessed hope, the appearing of the glory﻿ of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ. 14 He gave himself for us﻿ to redeem us from all lawlessness and to cleanse for himself a people for his own possession, eager to do good works. - **Titus 2:11–14**_

<a href="/a-side-note">I don't blame it on others</a> for my failure. But somehow I see the same difficulty in others in understanding the simplicity of the Gospel. Or maybe I got lost, with all the lights, and the sounds and the prophetic, and the conferences. I have been busy seeking and praying for some kind of **"superficial experience"** to come and get me.

I did nothing to save me, it's purely by His grace that I am saved but how can I approach a Holy God with all the mess in my life. I am sure there is not too much introspection here. After all, why would He save me? didn't He ask for repentance, and obedience, following, self-denial? Will He be okay if get back into the same mess He is saving me from?. Well, maybe I'm not really worshipping any idols but my life still doesn't show whom I'm worshipping.

I hate to compare, but I now work in a secular world and people out there behave so well. I get ashamed of me being so immoral/sinful yet calling myself a Christian. I fear that I might be even taking the name of the Lord in vain. It is only God's grace and mercy, that I am still alive.

Now maybe I have been **a baby Christian**, maybe it was hard for me to understand the Biblical truths, at least for what I was hearing - mostly on mysticism (true as they are), or on my identity or a little extra emphasis on abracadabra.

#### Keep the main thing, the main thing, the Gospel.

Who is working in the lives of the people?. It is God. Our fads/ideologies, our methods, or our ways of doing things and what we feel is right is literally devaluing the work of God in the lives of people. It is like saying "I think I know how God works". This is the way He does things, if He doesn't maybe you don't have enough faith to believe. Voila, blame it on people for not having enough faith. But really faith, even to believe is a gift, isn't it?.

> _Your worship leader's job is not to lead you into God's presence. Jesus has that covered. **- Matt Smethurst**_

God can use a simple song we sing and melt a heart. He doesn't need any kind of gimmicks to be performed so that He can finally show up. Where two or three are gathered He is already there. He doesn't wait until we reach a high at the end of our worship. God is not impressed with the kind of stuff we do as much as He is with <a href="/swoop-down-on-the-spoil">_obedience_</a>.

So what changed for me?. Let's <a href="/the-strength-to-hold-on">continue reading</a>.


<small>**Few scriptures to note:**
<em>**Romans 1:16** - For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God to salvation for everyone who believes, for the Jew first and also for the Greek.
**2 Timothy 2:15** - Make every effort to present yourself to God as one who is approved, a worker who has no need to be ashamed, correctly handling the word of truth.
**James 2: 18** - But someone will say, “You have faith, and I have works.” Show me your faith without your works, and I will show you my faith by my works.
**James 2: 20** - 20, But do you want to know, O foolish man, that faith without works is dead? 21 Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered Isaac his son on the altar? 22 Do you see that faith was working together with his works, and by works faith was made perfect?.
