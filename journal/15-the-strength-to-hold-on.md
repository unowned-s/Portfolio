<!-- >I am that prodigal son who doesn't have to prepare a speech so that my Father can accept me, for I know He's gonna throw a party before I can utter any words. - (Paraphrased) -->
_<small>Please read <a href="/a-baby-christian">second part</a> of this series to get a bit of context.</small>_

After a decade in my Christian life, I have been awakened to the truth of the Gospel, my sinfulness, and as a result for all the chaos. Truth, that I have a great redeemer. Truth, that I may be the worst of sinners but I have a great Saviour. I have now learned to trust God. God's plan for me or anyone will not be thwarted and what He has purposed will come to pass. **I am amazed at how this God has been working in my life in saving me from all that I mentioned**.

> _For godly sorrow produces repentance leading to salvation, not to be regretted; but the sorrow of the world produces death. 11For observe this very thing, that you sorrowed in a godly manner: What diligence it produced in you, what clearing of yourselves, what indignation, what fear, what vehement desire, what zeal, what vindication! In all things you proved yourselves to be clear in this matter. - **2 Corinthians 7:10**_

Thankfully, I've had some great men come alongside me and help me understand the truth, and help me get back to the Bible. These are faithful men and women, who wait patiently for a heavenly home. Selflessly, faithfully and in the fear of God, serving God with all their might - I promise you to come and meet them once, you'll not be the same person again. From my first Pastor Suresh and Rohini, Pastor George and Ann, Luke and Sunitha, Sibi and Vandana, Rajendra and Bhanu, Sahay and Kavita, Alwin and Daisy, to my current Pastor Benjamin and Rashmi sis, directly or indirectly have all been a witness for Jesus - as we are all supposed to be.

I would love to repeat this list on a better occasion because they deserve more than just a mention in some random post.

I didn't make their life easy. It was not just my stubbornness they had to deal with, It was not just my doctrines they had to deal with, not just my immorality, not just my work ethics, not just my theology, it was much much more, it was a different spirit altogether, but they could go through everything for the sake of their faith, and able to bear it. I would have been long gone but it is their **faith in action** that made me go through all the pain and gave me **the strength to hold on**, just for a little longer. I remember every single word of hope they have uttered. Some have even continued to pray even after I left them for various reasons.

It is through them I learned the value of humanity. When Jesus calls my name, I might hesitantly walk towards Him, with my hands holding behind, swinging my shoulders to my chin, and showing my teeth to everyone. But I'm sure I will hear their claps a little louder than the others no matter where they will be standing, and cheering me on "come on saanjeeev!!!". I'm afraid I might even burst forth into tears - but they say they are no tears. He will wipe away their tears. I guess it will be much better than when the elders gathered at the end of the book of Joshua, after reaching the promised land. Oh, what a day that will be.

The Bible has nothing to hide. Good and bad incidents it's all there in the Bible. When you look at the lives, almost all of the characters had no easy life. Look at Jesus, He was titled _" a Man of sorrows and acquainted with grief"_. Though He was and still is the Son of God, _yet he learned obedience by the things He suffered_. He had no easy life. He didn't give himself a pep-talk to keep himself positive or do yada-yada to walk in the Spirit. Creator of Heaven and earth, the Lord of the universe, He had to desert everyone to go to a solitary place to pray, completely dependant/relying on the Father, to do His will.

It's here we come back every single time and **learn to separate the real hurts from the pain that is amplified by our own lusts and longings.** _(letters in bold stolen from my pastor Benjamin)_

> "I am quite certain that if God had not chosen me, I should never have chosen Him; and I am sure He chose me before I was born, or else He never would have chosen me afterwards; and He must have elected me for reasons unknown to me, for I never could find in myself why He should have looked upon me with special love." - **Charles Spurgeon**.

Truly salvation belongs to our God. Jesus has done it for you and me. There is only one person who deserves all the glory and that is Jesus. No flesh shall glory in His presence. It is Christ's righteousness in me, it is His patient and saving grace, it is the ever-abiding presence of the Holy Spirit in me, His promise to never leave, nor forsake and to be there to the end, and He coming back to take me heaven. He is the guardian and anchor ⚓︎ of my soul. **Christ in me is the hope of glory**. He will always, always, always be faithful. There's no hit and miss for Him.
