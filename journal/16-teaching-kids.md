### Draft..

Some days we're gonna get married and have kids, take them to school, life is gonna be completely different than what we expect, at least way more different than what it is now.

If you're like me who was not fortunate enough to remember anything I've studied. Sometimes I think if I was even taught the things I should have been knowing. You ask me rain cycle and a kid of 7-8 years old can give a better answer than me.

So I decided to relearn the basics, if at all my son or daughter has to ask anything, I can give something and not act like a noob. I have been reading fact books on animals, human body, space and planet earth. Learning facts helps me understand how everything works. It creates an amazement of how the these things work, how they are so complex. It creates an awe of the creator of all things, the one who sustains everything. My worship just gets even more real from my narrow mindedness of just God sending His son to die for my sins. But look at Paul the way he explains things in the book of romans, though he wants to tell us about how and why we are saved but the way he using different metaphors and allegory and poetry, the style and genre to communicate the same truth in different ways again and again.

I have been really bad in understanding things, anything. I couldn't understand the Bible much may be just a pieces here and there, but mostly surface, without any depth. I thought to dig deeper.

Psalm 90, Isaiah 53
