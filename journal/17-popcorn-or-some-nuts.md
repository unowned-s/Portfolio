Every time I allow myself to look at a girl, (of course with an intention of getting married), I imagine _"could she my one and only?"_. But this is what is going on in my imaginary world.

If have any hint that the girl is a Christian, I go full speed, no wasting time (to at least find out before I dream dreams), my guardian angels are completely relaxed. But if I'm not sure she is a Christian, first I have all the scriptures (of warning) coming alive, like when you run through a magnifying glass and the letters pop out. There's a whole lot of things going on, as if there's a war is declared. There's an announcement going on _"alert, alert, Sanjeev is falling, Sanjeev is falling"_. Just then one of the angel allotted to my care who seems to be enjoying popcorn or some nuts, busy watching all the rescue operations by other angels on a giant screen in front of him, hears my name being called out, a few times over and says, "aww man, this guy sucks", murmuring within himself _"like we have rescued him a hundred times"_, completely startled, but then looks up to Jesus for once and then collects himself up and his gears, fly's down close to my vicinity and completely invisible, still munching all that's in his hands.

Waits for a few days, rescues me, leaves me crying (which he knows is nothing new) and then off he goes into the unknown.

> Please don't think that's how angels operate, second they don't use bad language, third they are assigned task, that is to watch over us, they never get tired of doing.

<!-- Imagine there's rejoicing over repentance of one sinner. They do eat when invited but not popcorns. When the angel of the Lord went to rescue Lot, they were invited to eat. The reason they are in heaven is because there is no uncleanness in them I guess. You cannot be in the presence of a Holy God with any of your unholiness. -->
