We are a group of individuals, coming together to do freelance work for people in need. Some of us are currently employed full-time and would like to follow strict guidelines and work ethics. That is why we do not plan to take any work at all. However, below are the list of services, which we take for weekends only. Again, if the project is big, we will not be able to take it. You are free to go ahead and get it done elsewhere. We will definitely want to help others, so please do get in touch.
