In all my posts, if it looks like I'm hitting at someone please be kind to not to make such assumptions.

Majority of all the doctrinal issues I'm trying to deal has all been imported from a group of people who came in on a mission trip to India, - the Byron bay tribe, Australia, and Micheal Shattuck from US, "mama k" (I don't remember her actual name) and others who brought in so much of poison in the church - I will be writing more about them in my own style so please watch out for a post "unhealthy influences in the body". Right from decoration at the Church stage, to tongues, prophetics, dances and declarations on finances, healings, so much to talk - let's keep it for another post. Still few more advancement has come in through god tv channel preachers.

But these doctrines (yes they are actually doctrines - but slightly deviated from the truth) have done so much wrong in the body. They have been exalted more than anything else. People were let go because of disagreement. I have grown up watching all that happen.

It's like kids playing on a sand at the beach. My young pastor was falling for it like the way I fall for girls. I shout discernment on social media, but it just doesn't work. I get afraid I might push them even further into the very thing I or anyone warning them about.

I am not blaming anyone for my failure, nor trying to hit at anyone. Lest I be like Adam who deflected his own responsibility and ends up blaming his wife. My response will always be I ain't no saint. I've persecuted the body in different ways, maybe my sins were being dealt and I didn't know. I don't want to pin my sin on people on how they have failed by not giving the right response. Our pervasive internal corruption and perversity are clear. So is our propensity to blame others for our sin.

I love the people and I pray for them more than anything else. I have knocked myself down on my knee and prayed.. ouch. My fight is not flesh and blood. This love just ends up displaying some other ways. Does it look good to show a different vibe against your own people on social media?. What is it am I gaining?. I loose people, friendship, a bad face in front of people. Defaming or putting down someone is not something I or anyone will ever enjoy.  No one will want to do such a thing. It literally kills me deep to hurt anyone. They already have enough on their plate. I would rather give up on this doctrinal issues, forget the world and just go on serving the Lord some remote place, go wherever He is calling me. Involving myself in these kinda issue requires so much of energy, it drains at other times. I know how much of trouble I have gone through myself. Yet, I don't want to force my convictions on someone else. God doesn't do that. God has certain boundary lines, and we will always do better to stay within those lines. These are my own people, I have been praying God will work mightily in ways I can never imagine.  

I miss my Church, with only focus on the Bible. Come put the mikes and strum the guitars, just sing, exalt Christ, no much emphasis on spiritual gifts, not more than the giver of the gifts. Where Christ is at the stage. The Gospel is shared, souls are getting saved, people being added to Kingdom. God's presence is manifested, broken lives are getting healed, restored, there's pure fellowship, no adulterated mix of ideologies, no flattery and certainly no pep-talks. No on the floor dancing (at least not during worship), no LED lights, no decorations and stuffs, no catering to people and their emotional needs. The Gospel doesn't advance with the times or the culture. If it is, then there is a much bigger problem that needs to be dealt with.

Please let me know if you still don't like/agree something.

_If I write thousand posts and have not love, I have become (whatever you name it). I will choose love, of course without compromising on truth._
