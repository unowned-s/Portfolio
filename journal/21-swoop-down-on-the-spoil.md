Saul thought he could impress God with the battle he won by sparing Agag the king of the Amalekites. God had told him to _**completely destroy everything**_. But just before he could hop around with a smily face not realising God was already displeased with Him, and had sent a word to Samuel.

>_10 Now the word of the Lord came to Samuel, saying, 11 “I greatly regret that I have set up Saul as king, for he has turned back from following Me, and has not performed My commandments.” And it grieved Samuel, and he cried out to the Lord all night. - **1 Samuel 15:10-11**_

Didn't Saul do what he was told?, yes of course, but not completely. Saul was required just plain, simple, obedience, no putting on a show. It's a matter of _obeying_. God is not impressed with the kind of stuff we do as much as He is with _obedience_.

> _22b Does the Lord﻿ take pleasure in burnt offerings and sacrifices as much as in obeying the Lord? Look: to obey is better than sacrifice, to pay attention is better than the fat of rams. 23a For rebellion is like the sin of divination, and defiance is like wickedness﻿ and idolatry... - **1 Samuel 15**_
