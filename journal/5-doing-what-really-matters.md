Countless hours are spent scrolling through profiles and pages. What we scroll is just user-generated content. It keeps feeding our craving for such information.

Have you wondered, why so many apps?. Hundreds of new social media apps, dating, camera filter, create memes and videos, and with an easy option to share it on any other platform. 
Youtube has surpassed all else when it comes to user generated content (besides plenty others). Everyone has become a free guide/mentor, a free flow of advice (that includes me). Type "how-to" in the search box and you'll get plenty of information on any given topic. A crazy load of junk is pushed in every single day. But for you and me, it's like it - like it - subscribe it, ring the bell icon and that'll make the guys who created the content happy and then share the same junk over. Even the most wisest find it difficult to navigate through without clicking any of those links.
It's designed in a way that it makes us keep coming back again and again, just to see what our friends have posted. Some have matured into how they handle their social presence.

The algorithms are designed in a way to make sure you get their content first every time you land that site or app again. And just in case if we missed a day or two, the notifications will do the perfect job of getting us back. If Facebook doesn't do it, maybe Twitter will, or Youtube, or Snapchat, or some other startup will come up and get you hooked to their cool new website or app.
Google or anyone else out there isn't bothered about how it's affecting people and minds. More the users are engaged on the site, more the revenue gets generated through advertisements, it doesn't matter if you shell out a few bucks to those who create the content.
The Era of Smartphones.

With growing countries like ours (I'm from India), we have a good number of educated and non-educated. Smartphones are available in almost every hand. And so it's very easy to get your target or even not targeted audience. They all get excited with the kind of content, the apps, to make funny stuff, and share it, young and old, men and woman have all fallen prey to the disease. It gives them the power to create what they crave! - temporary attention, fading recognition, you name it.
The smartphone is causing a social reversal: the desire to be alone in public and never alone in private. -Tony Reinke

Technology indeed has helped a lot. Creativity has taken a new dimension. We can connect from literally anywhere. Work from home, group meetings, family and friends gatherings couldn't have been possible without it (especially in lockdown).

A good number of people use social media to keep up with their friends and families, wish them on their birthdays and anniversaries, post some life events and it's all good. But some just don't know how their life has gone by. Our 24 hours have reduced to just 2–3 hours of real productivity work, and if lucky some sleep.

Imagine these kinda addictions get into some of the still-developing countries, not to forget us Indians, who are still trying to catch up with the developed ones.
A little pep talk!

Why wait for an inspiration to strike? or a situation to arise, why not take some time to do some productivity, or just do something. Why not make some plans, a to-do list, some goals, and work through it.

I don't mean to discourage, but you should be working on the task that is at hand. Things that matter. It doesn't always have to be something big, It's the way you think. It could be something really small and yet making a lot of difference.
Take home:

- Take a step back, count the cost.
- Start making some real plans, set priorities.
- What are the obstacles, how can you overcome them.
