Easier said than done, every hobby needs time. Time is something we all have it, (yes we all have). We are not different from anybody else who have gone a long way to follow through their dreams.

#### These are some of my hobbies which I have followed for years;

- Learn Programming / Language
- Drink Water (yes of course)
- Go running
- Play Football
- Have a regular life of prayer
- Start reading the Bible (with a plan)

#### These are my most recent ones;
- HIIT Exercises (Using 8fit app)
- Write a blog post
- Work on personal app projects
- Cook some nice dish
- Self learned Gymnast

#### Some more new ones;
- Studying about planet earth, the space, the animals, or the human body.
<small>I just pick up a book (mostly illustrated facts book) and start reading and my worship just gets even more real when I look at how God has created everything, sustains everything. It creates an awe of the wonderful things that God has done.</small>

#### Wishes and dreams / Want to do;
<!-- - Go as a missionary in remote places. -->
- Go hiking, explore, study about different places, and write it down.

It's easier to make hobbies and just work through it one day at a time.
