I will not be held responsible if anything from here is quoted/printed with my initials on it. These are just my thoughts which may not really have anything to support, please discern. Let's read on..._ </small>

I get up in the morning, do my exercises or go running, come back and wash the dishes (of last night if any), do some cleaning, freshen up, prepare breakfast, and get ready for my morning meeting. Just before that, say a word of prayer, and so I stand, close my legs, hold my hands, take a deep breath, and pray. Thank God for yet another day, express gratitude, commit my folks everywhere into His loving hands, pray for any person the Lord is bringing into my remembrance, thank God for all the people in my life, pray for any urgent needs (the country, or crisis), thank Him for protection, providence and His sustenance and end with amen. Next, I have my breakfast, then continue reading the book I had left off yesterday, flip through few pages of the Bible for any references and I'm all charged up for the day.

Now, I know you might be thinking "wow, this guy is cool aye 😎". But I just gave you an overview of my morning routine, though almost every day looks like it, with a few shuffled items. Anyways, let's come back to the title of this post. _Watch your thoughts!_.

Is my morning really good?. No doubt it is. God's mercies are new today. It doesn't matter what my yesterday has been, except for any pending tasks related to work, I don't have anything on my mind. So I'm actually doing pretty good.

As I start my work, my morning meetings are done, I'm doing my job well, any emails are replied and again everything is good. Since I have some free time, we all like to get distracted isn't it. So, I log in to Facebook (or even Twitter somedays), and I don't have to scroll any amount before I see some concerning posts. My thoughts, with my emotions, are skyrocketing. With little hesitation, I draft a reply, making it private just so that I don't end up posting it publicly since I don't trust my impulses. I post it, visible only to me. I'm feeling good about it. After all, I didn't ignore my stand for truth or put down my pride. Next, I'm waiting for just one another post and the volcano is gonna erupt. Voila! I know what you are thinking this time, "what a d** 🐶".

Now if I didn't write that last paragraph, you would've had some really good thoughts about me. So let's keep it that way. **But my thoughts of the morning are not the same anymore** (screaming). I was in such tranquility and peace and joy and the world (at least my world) was so much better. Had I just ignored the post before I could even draft (My posts are not always good), allowing myself to indulge in the very act (like the Pharisees say it). Because now it has become a much more serious issue since it springs forth from my heart. It's much like committing adultery just by the looks. The issue is the same.

That was just one instance of a mind captivated by thoughts that were not supposed to be even there in the first place. So, I repentantly, drag slowly to God, stand once again and hold my hands, this time close my eyes a little tighter than usual and pray - "Lord release me of this weight". And (In my imaginations) the Lord puts me in sackcloth, a bit of shake-shake and removes me out, and says "off you go". And there I am, sitting next to a window and I have a cool breeze blowing on my face.

Here's my problem, when the Lord delivers me from one mess and I love getting into another. This time it could be a chat with a girl, aah... What should've been a straightforward conversation, my chat box has turned out to be full of smiley and imaginary laughs. One thought leading to another and another. Next, I'm dreaming. I'm sure we all have something or the other to indulge in.

It doesn't necessarily have to be another "post" on social media to get agitated or some friendship/relationship stuff. We all have all sorts of thoughts running on our minds. Thoughts related to our work, colleagues, our different circles, our life-partner, marriage, finances, family, social injustice, some issue somewhere, or life in general, about how we're gonna make ends meet. And maybe just sometimes, we like to be in charge of the things we don't even have any control over.

Instead of setting some healthy boundaries and casting it out (throwing those thoughts afar off) before it starts taking root, we allow it to grow and sooner or later we are preoccupied with it, plenty of space is given and it's affecting us in every way.

In our own strength it will be difficult cut out those unhelpful/unhealthy thoughts every-time they spring up, but _**we have the mind of Christ**_ and our Lord can help us.

<!-- >_The heart includes the mind, and it is concerned with what we know._ -->

<!-- Here's a quote from the Book - **With All Your Heart**: Orienting Your Mind, Desires, and Will towards Christ by Troxel, A. Craig -->

<!-- >Our intellectual abilities—our thinking and planning, ideas and insights, musing and meditation, memories and imagination, knowledge and ignorance, wisdom and folly, doubts and convictions—are all attributed to the heart in the Bible. It may surprise you that out of all the times that the Hebrew word for “heart” appears in the Old Testament, our intellectual and rational functions are most often in view. What modern people would attribute to the head or to the brain, Scripture applies to the heart. The heart is not primarily an organ of emotion and intuition. Rather, it is the location of all “higher” human functions. The church father Augustine said that his thoughts were generated from the core of his being and “sprang up in [his] mind even out of the innermost of [his] heart.” The heart includes the mind, and it is concerned with what we know. -->

<small>**Here's few selected verses (CSB):**
**Ps 51:10** - God, create a clean heart for me and renew a steadfast spirit within me.
**Pr 4:23** - Guard your heart above all else, for it is the source of life.
**Eze 11:19** - I will give them integrity of heart and put a new spirit within them; I will remove their heart of stone from their bodies and give them a heart of flesh,
**Mt 5:8** - Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.
<!-- **Mt 22:37** - He said to him, “Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind. -->
<!-- **1 Co 2:16** - For who has known the Lord’s mind, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ. -->
<!-- **2 Co 3:14–15** - but their minds were hardened. For to this day, at the reading of the old covenant, the same veil remains; it is not lifted, because it is set aside only in Christ. Yet still today, whenever Moses is read, a veil lies over their hearts, -->
<!-- **Je 17:9–10** - The heart is more deceitful than anything else, and incurable—who can understand it? I, the Lord, examine the mind, I test the heart to give to each according to his way, according to what his actions deserve. -->
<!-- **Ro 8:5–7** - 5 For those who live according to the flesh have their minds set on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit have their minds set on the things of the Spirit. 6 Now the mindset of the flesh﻿ is death, but the mindset of the Spirit is life and peace. -->

<!-- **Ro 12:1–2** - Therefore, brothers and sisters, in view of the mercies of God, I urge you﻿ to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God; this is your true worship. 2 Do not be conformed﻿ to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may discern what is the good, pleasing, and perfect will﻿ of God. -->
