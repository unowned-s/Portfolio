After a not so hectic day, I log off from my working hours and turn to some leisure time. I normally play some songs, usually worship (instrumental) or contemporary gospel.

<!-- As I open Spotify, I see that one of the profiles I follow is listening to a song that catches my eye and so I click to play the same playlist. As it continues, "love story" and "change" by Taylor Swift and a few others by Coldplay catch my further attention. Now, I have heard both the artists before but I hesitate and often careful to not listen if they are not a Christian - it's a clear no. But man, But these are so good. -->

I have my friends who are musicians, who make a living on it. A few make it big, and a few struggle. With the rise of the internet, and technology, there is so much competition. Almost anyone can create from any smartphone device, using some simple apps. Though the quality cannot be matched with those of the professionals. But everyone is getting into it, create something new and post it on youtube and other social media. We all want to create something nice and get likes/views.

<!-- #### Warning: This is gonna be a pep-talk, please be nice to me. -->
So, here's what I think separates those who make _good music_ and those who make really _great_ ones. <small>(I am not a professional, I am no one to advise on this field. But hey I listen to music, I skip hundred of songs throughout the day, and though my taste is different, I kinda know how to differentiate between good music and bad one).</small>

- They take real good time to write the lyrics, every word is chosen thoughtfully and carefully. They don't rush when singing.
- They go for quality content; use of no extra instruments. Their Music support/respect the lyrics and the tone/voice.
- They limit unnecessary solo or any stringed instruments.
- They balance any higher-sounding instruments and even the too low ones.
- They consider their audience well, (as a musician you actually want everyone to like the song, but you seldom think when making it).
- They are genuine in everything: in voice and acting.
- They don't do it for self-glory, there is not disappointment if things don't work out as expected.

_Let there be competition_, you do it to your best, and do it often. It may look like a _battle of the best_. No, really, battle is for those who want to win. Winning is something they derive their identity from. But do it because you love what you do and you do it to the best of your abilities. Do it without any pressure, and bring the best out of you.
