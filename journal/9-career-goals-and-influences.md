_<small>I am trying to be careful not to mention any names throughout my blog. Though I could mean it genuinely but it doesn't end up well, not always. So I decided to have a separate post altogether, and hide it.</small>_

I take advice from people I value most. I watch their life, the words they speak, they have such genuineness in everything, they don't flatter you with words and it's so great to have people like that.

It was at the end of the church service my friend _Kadesh_ who just casually said why don't I pursue iOS app development. If anyone else had said that may be I wouldn't have taken it that serious, but really it was just the kind of push I needed to get into programming. I just went all out for it, it changed my whole world.

I am fortunate to have few other friends of my mine, _Joshua_ who encouraged me work on the websites and apps during those initial days of my venturing into software world.

The goal to pursue my career would have been very difficult if not impossible, had God not sent this great man - _Luke_, I just thank God for him.. It was he that came with a torch in my (may be dark) world and said... hasten, you have difficult journey to take on, let's go, and I'm with you. (paraphrasing all the WhatsApp messages).

### Still in draft,.. ;)

_(Just incase if you're wondering I have missed other good friends of mine who have been great influence, keep reading, I will add them in the near future because I'm sure I have written at great length about them, I can never miss, they are too dear to me, all of em..)_
